Hello! 

Within this repository you will find two files:
a file called 'pods' and a file called 'Script1'

The 'pods' file should not be touched however there are some variables within the Script1 file that may need setting.

The script will use user inputs to determine certain actions- where to save a file to etc- for ease of use I am providing below some defaults that can be copied into the relevant variables rather than typing by hand each time.

URL="https://github.com/TWilkinson1/Docker_Diss/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"
SAVE_PATH="/users/<user>/desktop/<file_name>" 
DOCKER_PATH="/users/<user>/desktop/<file_name>/main"
IMAGE_NAME="my_image"

K8_PATH="/users/<user>/<path to 'pods' file>
FILE_POD="pod.yaml" <or name of yml file containing pod>
POD_NAME="test-pod" <or name of pod to be patched>

IMAGE_NAME="my_image"

The URL will download a docker file I have saved in my GitHub repo- this is likely the easiest one for you to use as other Dockerfiles require a significant amount of configuration changes. 

User above equates to your username- mine would be Thomas.Wilkinson
File name equates to whatever you choose the file to be called- I use test_code.

please note- IMAGE_NAME must equal whatever value is set in 'value' on line 146 as this is a flaw in the Kubernetes patching- this variable cannot be dynamic. I reccommend leaving it as my_image.

You must also ensure Docker is installed and the namespace is set to docker-desktop. The installation of Docker must be in the default /usr/local/bin/docker location. Or the docker create function will need to be updated.

To run this script pleasem cd to script1 and run 'bash script2'

you must have kubectl and bash installed for this to function.

The user inputs will be enabled upon my submission, however these can be commented out and the variables at the top of the script hard-coded.

The output of the script will be two 'kubectl describe pods' and two time stamps. Within this output we can see the change in image name- proving the script works.

I will also enclose a recording of the script functioning to allow you to see it in action if you choose not to operate the script yourself.
